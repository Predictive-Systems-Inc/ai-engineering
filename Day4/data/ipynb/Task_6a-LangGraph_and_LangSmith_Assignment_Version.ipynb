            "Tool Response: Large language models (LLMs) are incredibly powerful tools for processing and generating text. However, they inherently struggle to understand the broader context of information, especially when dealing with lengthy conversations or complex tasks. This is where large context windows and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) come into play. Google recently released Gemini 1.5 Pro, a large language model boasting a mammoth one million token context window. This sparked a buzz in the AI community, with some dubbing it the \"RAG killer.\" Before we rush to write eulogies for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), let's take a deep breath and analyze the situation from an enterprise perspective. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, retrieval-augmented large language models have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In the rapidly evolving landscape of language models, the debate between Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Long Context Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention. Using RAG 2.0, we've created our first set of Contextual Language Models (CLMs), which achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of industry benchmarks. CLMs outperform strong RAG baselines based on GPT-4 and the best open-source models by a large margin, according to our research and our customers.\n",

This approach is important because it allows for efficient finetuning of ...\n",

            "Tool Response: The attention mechanism is a technique used in machine learning and natural language processing to increase model accuracy by focusing on relevant data. It enables the model to focus on certain areas of the input data, giving more weight to crucial features and disregarding unimportant ones. 1. Introduction. Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning. It plays a pivotal role in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. The self-attention mechanism is a key component in modern machine learning models, particularly when dealing with sequential data. This blog post aims to provide a detailed overview of this ... The concept of \"attention\" in deep learning has its roots in the effort to improve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for handling longer sequences or sentences. For instance, consider translating a sentence from one language to another. Translating a sentence word-by-word is usually not an option because it ignores the complex grammatical ...
